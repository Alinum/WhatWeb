WhatWeb - Next generation web scanner.

Identify content management systems (CMS), blogging platforms, stats/analytics packages, javascript libraries, servers and more. When you visit a website in your browser the transaction includes many unseen hints about how the webserver is set up and what software is delivering the webpage. Some of these hints are obvious, eg. "Powered by XYZ" and others are more subtle. WhatWeb recognises these cues and reports what it finds.

WhatWeb has over 500 plugins and needs community support to develop more. Plugins can identify systems with obvious identifying hints removed by also looking for subtle clues. For example, a WordPress site might remove the tag <meta name="generator" content="WordPress 2.6.5"> but the WordPress plugin also looks for "wp-content" which is less easy to disguise. Plugins are flexible and can return any datatype, for example plugins can return version numbers, email addresses, account ID's and more.

There are both passive and aggressive plugins, passive plugins use information on the page, in cookies and in the URL to identify the system. A passive request is as light weight as a simple GET / HTTP/1.1 request. Aggressive plugins guess URLs and request more files. Plugins are easy to write, you don't need to know ruby to make them.


EXAMPLE USAGE

Using WhatWeb on a handful of websites, standard WhatWeb output is in colour.

LOG OUTPUT

There are currently 6 types of log output. They are:
	--log-brief=FILE	Log brief, one-line output. Default output.
	--log-full=FILE		Log verbose output (might be removed in future)
	--log-xml=FILE		Log XML format
	--log-json=FILE		Log JSON format
	--log-json-verbose=FILE	Log JSON Verbose format
	--log-errors=FILE	Log errors. This is usually printed to the screen in red.

You can output to multiple logs simulatenously by specifying muliple command line logging options.

Brief Logging.

Example usage: whatweb --brief-full b.log digg.com

http://digg.com [200] X-Powered-By[PHP/5.2.9-digg8], Cookies[1337,PHPSESSID,ccc], UncommonHeaders[keep-alive], Title[Digg - The Latest News Headlines, Videos and Images], HTTPServer[Apache], Mailto, Header-Hash[2df7eaaa4480f28013aaf48ae9266b84], MD5[24bc43e698e5d1388e836f5eee094fbe], Footer-Hash[ca2ffbc939969a2246cde196f0fc4841], Div-Span-Structure[828d809947c3c760d41c720c9203993b]

This is one connection per line and is searchable with grep.



XML Logging

The XML logging is currently naive and may change. Please contact me if you have suggestions.

Example usage: ./whatweb --log-xml x.log digg.com

	Plugin Information
	------------------------------
	Joomla version 0.4 by Andrew Horton
	[14] examples, [3] matches, [x] aggressive, [x] passive.
	Description: Opensource CMS written in PHP. Homepage: http://joomla.org. Plugin can aggresively identify version by comparing md5 hashes of 4 files. Valid up to version 1.5.15.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WRITING PLUGINS

To get started modify plugin-template.rb.txt in the my-plugins folder. Also read the (out of date) tutorial on writing WhatWeb plugins at www.morningstarsecurity.com/downloads/How-to-develop-WhatWeb-plugins-1.1.txt.

A typical plugin looks like this:

	Plugin.define "Plone" do
	author "Andrew Horton"
	version "0.2"
	description "CMS http://plone.org"
	examples %w| www.norden.org www.trolltech.com www.plone.net www.smeal.psu.edu|

	matches [
	{:name=>"meta generator tag",
	:regexp=>/<meta name="generator" content="[^>]*http:\/\/plone.org" \/>/},

	{:name=>"plone css",
	:regexp=>/(@import url|text\/css)[^>]*portal_css\/.*plone.*css(\)|")/}, #"

	{:name=>"plone javascript",
	:regexp=>/src="[^"]*ploneScripts[0-9]+.js"/}, #"

	{:text=>'<div class="visualIcon contenttype-plone-site">'},

	{:name=>"div tag, visual-portal-wrapper",
	:certainty=>75,
	:text=>'<div id="visual-portal-wrapper">'},
	]

	def passive
		m=[]
		#X-Caching-Rule-Id: plone-content-types
		#X-Cache-Rule: plone-content-types
		m << {:name=>"X-Caching-Rule-Id: plone-content-types" } if @meta["x-caching-rule-id"] =~ /plone-content-types/i
		m << {:name=>"X-Cache-Rule: plone-content-types" } if @meta["x-cache-rule"] =~ /plone-content-types/i
		m
	end


	end

There are 3 levels to a plugin. Simple matches, passive and agressive tests. You don’t need to know ruby to write plugins with simple matches. Passive and aggressive tests are written in ruby.


The matches [] array contains a set of ways to match a website to a system.
The methods are:
	* :text			Matches text within the webpage
	* :regexp		A regular expression. Append /i for case insensitive matches
	* :ghdb			Like a google query
	* :md5			MD5 hash of the HTML page
	* :tagpattern		Pattern of HTML tags
	* :name			This is the name of the match, and is optional.
	* :url			The URL has to match this. Used for passive and agressive testing
	* :certainty		Optional, defaults to 100. Values are maybe (25), probably (75) and certain (100).
	* :version		As a string or number this is a version returned when other methods match
	* :version		As a regular expression, this extracts the version information from the HTML. Also requires :version_regexp_offset=>1


If you port a GHDB match, use :ghdb. I usually rewrite the GHDB matches with regular expressions, especially if they require inurl:

Example:
	# http://johnny.ihackstuff.com/ghdb?function=detail&id=1840
	{ :ghdb=>'"Powered by Vsns Lemon" intitle:"Vsns Lemon"' }

Note the GHDB queries are case insensitive, as a Google query is.

Supported GHDB codes are:
	* intitle:
	* inurl:
	* filetype:


Each plugin can access @body, @meta, @status, @base_uri, @md5 and @tagpattern variables. 

Passive tests add matches to the m array, each match is a hash containing the name of the match, probability and more.
The entire hash is returned with Full output, Brief output returns just the match, :version and :string

To discover the regular expressions to match against, wget about 20-30 examples into the tests/ folder. Be aware that some software can have dramatic variations between versions.



AGGRESSIVE PLUGINS

There are currently aggressive plugins for Joomla, phpBB, FluxBB, OSCommerce and Tomcat.
With the passive plugin we know that ardentcreative.co.nz is running Joomla version 1.5

$ ./whatweb ardentcreative.co.nz
http://ardentcreative.co.nz [301] HTTPServer[Apache], RedirectLocation[http://www.ardentcreative.co.nz/], Title[301 Moved Permanently], Header-Hash[0670664f07b972398a96c6a58e812c2d], MD5[0670664f07b972398a96c6a58e812c2d]
http://www.ardentcreative.co.nz/ [200] Cookies[e964b8ff6be2b1058b145da14a39e90d], MetaGenerator[Joomla! 1.5 - Open Source Content Management], Joomla[1.5], Google-Analytics[GA][791888], HTTPServer[Apache], Title[Ardent Creative, Christchurch Web Design], Footer-Hash[a19d726fa577100ccaec0c61b1bf8ea7], MD5[fcb3ec0dfafae53dfdef2e991a24f1c1], Div-Span-Structure[e56dd07d6f482ee11873e4ea99a9e6a8], Header-Hash[4379923363b07114470ba24584214e3f]

With the aggressive plugin we know that ardentcreative.co.nz is running Joomla version 1.5.13 - 1.5.14

$ ./whatweb -a 3 ardentcreative.co.nz
http://ardentcreative.co.nz [301] HTTPServer[Apache], RedirectLocation[http://www.ardentcreative.co.nz/], Title[301 Moved Permanently], Header-Hash[0670664f07b972398a96c6a58e812c2d], MD5[0670664f07b972398a96c6a58e812c2d]
http://www.ardentcreative.co.nz/ [200] Cookies[e964b8ff6be2b1058b145da14a39e90d], MetaGenerator[Joomla! 1.5 - Open Source Content Management], Joomla[1.5,1.5.15], Google-Analytics[GA][791888], HTTPServer[Apache], Title[Ardent Creative, Christchurch Web Design], Footer-Hash[a19d726fa577100ccaec0c61b1bf8ea7], MD5[fcb3ec0dfafae53dfdef2e991a24f1c1], Div-Span-Structure[e56dd07d6f482ee11873e4ea99a9e6a8], Header-Hash[4379923363b07114470ba24584214e3f]

Do not use aggressive plugins with recursive site crawling. WhatWeb has no understanding of a website, instead it currently treats each URL separately. 
It also has no caching so if you use aggressive plugins with recursion you will fetch the same files multiple times. The same is true for aggressive modes on redirecting URLs.



RECURSIVE SPIDER

The recursion option is used to scan some or all of a website with whatweb. Recursive spidering will follow each link on a webpage if it is within the same website, then repeat the process on the followed pages.

The configurable settings for recursive spidering are:
	--recursion, -r		Follow links recursively. Only follows links under the path (default: off)
	--depth, -d		Maximum recursion depth (default: 3)
	--max-links, -m		Maximum number of links to follow on one page (default: 25)

The spider skips this hardcoded list of file extensions:
/\.zip$/,/\.gz$/,/\.tar$/,/\.jpg$/,/\.exe$/,/\.png$/,/\.pdf$/

Limitations of the spidering. This follows links in <a> tags, these are the HTML tags designed specifically for links. The spider does not obtain urls from other sources. Some good choices for future improvement are image tags, eg. <img src="/images/boats.jpg">, form tags, eg. <form action="/vote.php">, url paths in CSS files, etc.

The spider is provided by Anemone, a third party ruby gem. It doesn't follow redirects. For example the URL treshna.com will fail and www.treshna.com will produce results.


KNOWN ISSUES OR BUGS

* The web spider, Anemone doesn't following 302 redirects
* Don't use aggressive modes with website spidering as it will repeat the tests and URL requests.
* :text matches are case sensitive
* :regexp matches are case sensitive, you can make then case insensitive by appending i, eg. /foobar/i
* The MD5 hashing algorithm is used not for it's security but for it's speed as a hashing algorithm especially compared to SHA1
* Timeout settings do not apply to the Anemone spider
* Meta refresh redirects do not apply to the Anemone spider


RELATED PROJECTS

WhatWeb is unique however there are some web projects with the same goal of identifying a website.

www.whatweb.net
Brendan Coles has set up a web frontend to WhatWeb.
http://www.whatweb.net/

Blind Elephant
The BlindElephant Web Application Fingerprinter attempts to discover the version of a (known) web application by comparing static files at known locations against precomputed hashes for versions of those files in all all available releases. The technique is fast, low-bandwidth, non-invasive, generic, and highly automatable.
http://blindelephant.sourceforge.net/

WAFP - Web Application Finger Printing
Wafp identifies systems by requesting a large quantity of URLs and comparing md5 sums of the results against a database. This method is reliable for known systems in the database and it is simple to add new ones. Unlike whatweb, this method is intrusive and will create a lot of webserver log entries.
http://www.mytty.org/wafp

Wappalyzer
This is the most similar project to WhatWeb.
Firefox plugin identifies sites using 1 regexp each. Only looks for obvious identifiers like meta generator tags. Sends all recognized urls to a DB. Has nice icons
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10229

w3af
http://w3af.sourceforge.net
Very slight overlap of features in the grep and discovery scripts section.

HTTPRecon
No feature overlap, fingerprints the HTTP Server
http://w3dt.net/tools/httprecon/
http://www.net-square.com/httprint/httprint_paper.html
http://www.darknet.org.uk/2007/09/httprint-v301-web-server-fingerprinting-tool-download/

Nmap version scan
Nmap shows some info about HTTP servers when using version scan, eg. nmap -sV -p80 treshna.com

THC's Amap
This tool is an application fingerprint scanner which can identify an HTTP protocol server. It doesn't identify types of HTTP servers.

What's that web server running 1.0 (whatweb.exe)
This shares the same name and goal but is shit. It ONLY uses the HTTP Server string. For example 'Apache/2.0.55 (Ubuntu) PHP/5.1.2'
http://www.spambutcher.com/whatweb.html

http-stats.com
Lots of info about HTTP server names

Builtwith.com
Stats of popularity of web stuff.

FUNNY & UNUSUAL
Slashdot.org
X-Fry: You mean Bender is the evil Bender? I'm shocked! Shocked! Well not that shocked.

popurls.com
X-popurls-a: in the future every url will be popular for 1.5 seconds

reddit.com
HTTPServer:'; DROP TABLE servertypes; --
